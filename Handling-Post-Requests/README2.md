Testing and modifications to html post to node and respond example.
Just trying to make a simple input form for set point and other vars
to change the controller behavior without restarting the main js.
Got a good start on handling posts from http://blog.thekfactor.info/posts/an-introduction-to-node-js-and-handling-post-requests/ 
Now I need to handle the radio button toggle for On/Off.
This may require a lot of change to splitter.js and most of the code
to handle this input may need to go in a seperate module.
